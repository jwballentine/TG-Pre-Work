// Write your code below
let vacationSpots = ['Las Vegas', 'Vancouver', 'Tokyo'];

console.log(vacationSpots[0]);
console.log(vacationSpots[1]);
console.log(vacationSpots[2]);

// I manually iterated over an array, logging each item to the console.  This illustartes the difficulty of dealing with really large datasets
